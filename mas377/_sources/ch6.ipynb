    "We will make the simplifying assumption that the birth rate and death rate are equal, so that the population would be at equilibrium in the absence of disease (this is a rather questionable assumption for many ecological populations, but perhaps reasonable for modern human populations). This gives the equations:\n",

    "Once more, $dN/dt=0$ so we can eliminate $R=N-(S+I)$. One thing to note here is that the infectious period has changed to be $1/(\\gamma+\\mu)$. When we define $R_0$, therefore, in our updated model we will have $R_0=\\beta N/(\\gamma+\\mu)$.\n",

    "## Endemic disease\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we could non-dimensionalise our system as we have seen previously. This would allow us to reduce the number of parameters in our model to make life easier, as well as revealing potentially useful information about the scales involved. This has been left for you to consider in the Homework Sheet. For now, though, let us continue with our analysis as before.\n",

    "First we need to find the steady states of our system, where $dS/dt=0$ and $dI/dt=0$ simultaneously. There are two cases where $dI/dt=0$:\n",
