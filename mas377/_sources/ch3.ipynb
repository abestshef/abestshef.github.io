    "Beyond this graphical method it would obviously be useful if we can formally characterise these equilibria in some way, and in particular assess when each will be an attracting end-point of the dynamics (the equilibrium is **stable**) and when not (the equilibrium is **unstable**). Much like we did with the logistic model, we can assess the local stability of steady states of a system by linearising around the equilibrium and finding the eigenvalues by studying the Jacobian matrix. Let us suppose that $dR/dt=f(R,G)$ and $dG/dt=g(R,G)$. Then the Jacobian matrix is made up of the partial derivatives of $f$ and $g$,\n",
