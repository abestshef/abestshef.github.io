        "In the first model, the number of infections always dropped to 0. That's because eventually most people became immune, so there were not many susceptible people left to infect, and so the disease died out. We call this a *disease-free equilibrium*. Now, though, there are still people infected at the end. That's because people start losing immunity and go back to being susceptible, and they can then get infected again (multiple times). When a disease persists in the long-term like this we call it an *endemic equilibrium*. Diseases that are endemic pose some different problems for public health than diseases which die out after an epidemic."

Vaccinating members of the population primes their immune system in a safe way (often vaccines contain dead virus, so the immune system will react to it but the virus cannot actually spread and grow in the body). In terms of our model, then, we can think of this as moving individuals from the susceptible group to the recovered group, completely bypassing getting infected.\n",

In that case the condition for a disease to spread is,\n",

        "\n",
        "Traditionally herd immunity has been thought of purely in this context of vaccination. If we can vaccinate enough of the population, we can push down infection rates enough to prevent diseases. The data shows that this has in fact worked. For example, prior to the first vaccine in the 1970s, there were around 500,000 cases of measles in the UK every year. Measles has an R0 of 10-15, meaning we need 90%-93% of the population to be vaccinated. In the early 1990s we had hit that target, and cases of measles dropped to fewer than 100. Unfortuantely, anti-vaccination messaging in the mid-1990s led to a substantial drop in the proportion of children immunised against measles, and we have since seen a number of large measles outbreaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the Covid-19 pandemic, herd immunity began to be used in a slightly different context, as an argument for allowing *natural* immunity to develop through infection, and that this would ultimately cause the disease to die out. As we have already seen, that cannot be taken for granted if immunity wanes (and a number of other reasons we've not covered). But even if immunity was perfect, the strategy (which really means doing nothing) misses an important point. Let's say the $R_0$ of a disease is 3. That would give a herd immunity threshold of 66.7%. Supporters of this strategy would then say that we let that many people get infected - with some attempt to shield the most vulnerable - and then the disease dies out and all is well. But look back at your first plot. Where is the herd immunity threshold met? It is precisely at the peak of the epidemic (which makes sense because at that point the numbers of infected start to decline so the onward transmission rate must be less than 1). But there are still a lot of people who will get infected on the downard slope. In fact the total number infected by the end of the epidemic is more like 92%, a much higher figure that would be almost impossible to protect the vulnerable from."

The key aspect of these is that if we use the same values for all our parameters and the same starting conditions, we will get the exact same results every time. They are therefore entirely predictable, hence the name \"deterministic\" (you may or may not be surprised to know that even chaotic systems are in fact deterministic). An alternative approach is a *stochastic* model. In this case we include randomness in our model, which leads to a different outcome every time we run our model.\n",

You will also see a red dot marking where the stochastic simulation says the infection dies out. You should see that you get a bit of variation between the 20 runs - for example in the height and timing of the peak and the point when the infection dies out - but that the deterministic model does ok as an average.\n",

It is interesting (I think!) that even with just a 3 day isolation period, having 50% or more of the populaiton test can make a big impact on reducing the epidemic. Reducing the class size has a somewhat lesser effect, and changing the isolation period and number of contacts traced makes very little difference at all. It is reasonably easy to find combinations of moderate amounts of each control - and so would not be too disruptive - that can more or less prevent an epidemic occurring."

Another simple way of modelling this is to assume the population lives on a square lattice.

        "If you look at time-courses for a high value of $L$ (mainly local interactions), you will see that the epidemic is much flatter and smaller than if you choose a low value of $L$ (mainly global interactions). However, this reduction in epidemic severity does not happen steadily/gradually. Even a value of $L$ of $0.4$ or $0.5$ produces pretty similar epidemics to if there were no local interactions at all. You have to have a pretty high proportion of local interactions, often $L>0.8$, to see a large effect of movement restrictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can see why this is from the animation. When $L$ is large, the majority of infections occur locally. Once an individual has infected all their neighbours, they run out of susceptible contacts and the local epidemic slows down. In contrast, when $L$ is small so that infected individuals frequently have global contacts, the infection can easily spread to a new area of the grid and start a new local epidemic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another thing to notice is the variation in the time-courses for the stochastic model runs. This is especially evident at low values of $R_0$ and mid-to-high values of $L$, where the peak and total number infected can vary widely for the exact same system and parameters.\n",
