# Research

In our group we use mathematical and computational tools to understand the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Research questions we have recently addressed include:

* How do seasonal environments impact the evolution of host defence to parasites?
* How does the ratio of 'global' vs 'local' interactions impact disease spread and evolution?
* Does the presence of a predator alter host and parasite evolution?
* What is the optimal class size to limit an epidemic amongst a University cohort?

# Teaching

I teach a range of mathematics and statistics modules, mostly focussing on mathematical modelling of real-world problems. You can find materials for current courses below:

* [MAS377 Mathematical Biology](/mas377/)
* [MAS316 Mathematical Modelling of Natural Systems](/mas316notes) (notes only)

# Public engagement

I have developed some interactive web apps for use at public engagement and schools outreach events:

* [How do local interactions impact an epidemic?](https://bit.ly/local_epi)
* [How can we control an epidemic on a university campus?](https://bit.ly/epi_uni_app)
* [Discover STEM 2022 workshop](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qwQCiG0zUrQxmKWLenDXY_QQGN4SL6gi#scrollTo=fQhNbobhg7QC) (Requires a Sheffield GMail account)
