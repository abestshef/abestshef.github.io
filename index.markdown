I am a maths lecturer, disease modeller, parent, husband, cook, book-lover and very amateur baseball player.

# Research

In our group we use mathematical and computational tools to understand the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Research questions we have recently addressed include:

* How do seasonal environments impact the evolution of host defence to parasites?
* How does the ratio of 'global' vs 'local' interactions impact disease spread and evolution?
* Does the presence of a predator alter host and parasite evolution?
* What is the optimal class size to limit an epidemic amongst a University cohort?

# Teaching

I teach a range of mathematics and statistics modules, mostly focussing on mathematical modelling of real-world problems. You can find materials for current courses below:

* MAS377 Mathematical Biology

# Public engagement

I have developed some interactive web apps for use at public engagement and schools outreach events:

* [How do local interactions impact an epidemic?](bit.ly/local_pi)
* [How can we control an epidemic on a university campus?](bit.ly/epi_uni_app)
